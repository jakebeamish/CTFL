[Testing](Testing.md) and [Debugging](Debugging.md) are separate activities. [Testing](Testing.md) can trigger [failures](Failure.md) that are caused by [defects](Defect.md) in the software ([Dynamic testing](Dynamic%20testing.md)) or can directly find defects in the [Test object](Test%20object.md) ([Static testing](Static%20testing.md)). When [Dynamic testing](Dynamic%20testing.md) (see chapter 4) triggers a [Failure](Failure.md), [Debugging](Debugging.md) is concerned with finding causes of this [Failure](Failure.md) ([defects](Defect.md)), analysing these causes, and eliminating them. The typical [Debugging](Debugging.md) process in this case involves:
- Reproduction of a [Failure](Failure.md)
- Diagnosis (finding the [Root cause](Root%20cause.md))
- Fixing the cause

Subsequent [Confirmation testing](Confirmation%20testing.md) checks whether the fixes resolved the problem. Preferably, [Confirmation testing](Confirmation%20testing.md) is done by the same person who performed the initial test. Subsequent [Regression testing](Regression%20testing.md) can also be performed, to check whether the fixes are causing [failures](Failure.md) in other parts of the [Test object](Test%20object.md) (see section 2.2.3 for more information on [Confirmation testing](Confirmation%20testing.md) and [Regression testing](Regression%20testing.md)). When [Static testing](Static%20testing.md) identifies a [Defect](Defect.md), [Debugging](Debugging.md) is concerned with removing it. There is no need for reproduction or diagnosis, since [Static testing](Static%20testing.md) directly finds defects, and cannot cause failures (see chapter 3).
