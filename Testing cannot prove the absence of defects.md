Testing shows the presence, not the absence of [[Defect|defects]]. Testing can show that defects are present in the [[Test object|test object]], but cannot prove that there are no defects (Buxton 1970). Testing reduces the probability of defects remaining undiscovered in the test object, but even if no defects are found, testing cannot prove test object correctness.
