If the same tests are repeated many times, they become increasingly ineffective in detecting new [[Defect|defects]] (Beizer 1990). To overcome this effect, existing tests and test data may need to be modified, and new tests may need to be written. However, in some cases, repeating the same tests can have a beneficial outcome, e.g., in automated [[Regression testing]] (see section 2.2.3).
