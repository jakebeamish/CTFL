> DevOps is an organisational approach aiming to create synergy by getting development (including [Testing](Testing.md)) and operations to work together to achieve a set of common goals. DevOps requires a cultural shift within an organisation to bridge the gaps between development (including [Testing](Testing.md)) and operations while treating their functions with equal value. DevOps promotes team autonomy, fast feedback, integrated toolchains, and technical practices like [continuous integration (CI)](Continuous%20Integration.md) and continuous delivery (CD). This enables the teams to build, test and release high-quality code faster through a DevOps delivery pipeline (Kim 2016).
>
> From the [Testing](Testing.md) perspective, some of the benefits of DevOps are:
> - Fast feedback on the code [Quality](Quality.md), and whether changes adversely affect existing code
> - [CI](Continuous%20Integration.md) promotes a [shift-left approach](Shift-Left%20Approach.md) in testing (see section 2.1.5) by encouraging developers to submit high quality code accompanied by component tests and static analysis
> - Promotes automated processes like CI/CD that facilitate establishing stable test environments
> - Increases the view on non-functional [Quality](Quality.md) characteristics (e.g., performance, reliability)
> - Automation through a delivery pipeline reduces the need for repetitive manual testing
> - The [Risk](Risk.md) in regression is minimised due to the scale and range of automated regression tests
>
> DevOps is not without its risks and challenges, which include:
> - The DevOps delivery pipeline must be defined and established
> - CI/CD tools must be introduced and maintained
> - Test automation requires additional resources and may be difficult to establish and maintain
> Although DevOps comes with a high level of automated testing, manual testing - especially from the user's perspective - will still be needed.[^1]
