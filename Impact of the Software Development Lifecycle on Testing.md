> Testing must be adapted to the [SDLC](Software%20Development%20Lifecycle.md) to succeed. The choice of the [SDLC](Software%20Development%20Lifecycle.md) impacts on the:

>- Scope and timing of test activities (e.g., test levels and [Test Types](Test%20Types.md))
>- Level of detail of test documentation
>- Choice of test techniques and [test approach](Test%20approach.md)
>- Extent of test automation
>- Role and responsibilities of a tester

> In sequential development models, in the initial phases testers typically participate in requirement reviews, [test analysis](Test%20analysis.md), and [test design](Test%20design.md). The executable code is usually created in the later phases, so typically [Dynamic testing](Dynamic%20testing.md) cannot be performed early in the [SDLC](Software%20Development%20Lifecycle.md). In some iterative and incremental development models, it is assumed that each iteration delivers a working prototype or product increment. This implies that in each iteration both [static](Static%20testing.md) and [Dynamic testing](Dynamic%20testing.md) may be performed at all test levels. Frequent delivery of increments requires fast feedback and extensive [regression testing](Regression%20testing.md). Agile software development assumes that change may occur throughout the project. Therefore, lightweight work product documentation and extensive test automation to make [Regression testing](Regression%20testing.md) easier are favoured in agile projects. Also, most of the manual testing tends to be done using experience-based test techniques (see Section 4.4) that do not require extensive prior [Test analysis](Test%20analysis.md) and design.[^1]
