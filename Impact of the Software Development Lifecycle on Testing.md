> Testing must be adapted to the [[Software Development Lifecycle|SDLC]] to succeed. The choice of the [[Software Development Lifecycle|SDLC]] impacts on the:

>- Scope and timing of test activities (e.g., test levels and test types)
>- Level of detail of test documentation
>- Choice of test techniques and [[Test approach|test approach]]
>- Extent of test automation
>- Role and responsibilities of a tester

> In sequential development models, in the initial phases testers typically participate in requirement reviews, [[Test analysis|test analysis]], and [[Test design|test design]]. The executable code is usually created in the later phases, so typically [[dynamic testing]] cannot be performed early in the [[Software Development Lifecycle|SDLC]]. In some iterative and incremental development models, it is assumed that each iteration delivers a working prototype or product increment. This implies that in each iteration both [[Static testing|static]] and [[dynamic testing]] may be performed at all test levels. Frequent delivery of increments requires fast feedback and extensive [[Regression testing|regression testing]]. Agile software development assumes that change may occur throughout the project. Therefore, lightweight work product documentation and extensive test automation to make [[regression testing]] easier are favoured in agile projects. Also, most of the manual testing tends to be done using experience-based test techniques (see Section 4.4) that do not require extensive prior [[test analysis]] and design.[^1]
