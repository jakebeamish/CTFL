> Human beings make [errors](Error.md) (mistakes), which produce [defects](Defect.md) (faults, bugs), which in turn may result in [failures](Failure.md). Humans make errors for various reasons, such as time pressure, complexity of work products, processes, infrastructure or interactions, or simply because they are tired or lack adequate training.
> 
> Defects can be found in documentation, such as a requirements specification or a test script, in source code, or in a supporting artefact such as a build file. Defects in artefacts produced earlier in the [SDLC](Software%20Development%20Lifecycle.md), if undetected, often lead to defective artefacts later in the lifecycle. If a defect in code is executed, the system may fail to do what it should do, or do something it shouldnâ€™t, causing a [failure](Failure.md). Some [defects](Defect.md) will always result in a [failure](Failure.md) if executed, while others will only result in a [failure](Failure.md) in specific circumstances, and some may never result in a [failure](Failure.md).

> [Errors](Error.md) and [defects](Defect.md) are not the only cause of failures. Failures can also be caused by environmental conditions, such as when radiation or electromagnetic field cause defects in firmware.
> 
> A [root cause](Root%20cause.md) is a fundamental reason for the occurrence of a problem (e.g., a situation that leads to an [error](Error.md)). Root causes are identified through root cause analysis, which is typically performed when a [failure](Failure.md) occurs or a [defect](Defect.md) is identified. It is believed that further similar [failures](Failure.md) or [defects](Defect.md) can be prevented or their frequency reduced by addressing the [root cause](Root%20cause.md), such as by removing it.
