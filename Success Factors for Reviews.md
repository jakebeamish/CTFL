> There are several factors that determine the success of [reviews](Review.md), which include:
> - Defining clear objectives and measurable exit criteria. Evaluation of participants should never be an objective
> - Choosing the appropriate review type to achieve the given objectives, and to suit the type of work product, the review participants, the project needs and context
> - Conducting reviews on small chunks, so that reviewers do not lose concentration during an individual review and/or the review meeting (when held)
> - Providing feedback from reviews to stakeholders and authors so they can improve the product and their activities (see section 3.2.1)
> - Providing adequate time to participants to prepare for the review
> - Support from management for the review process
> - Making review part of the organisation's culture, to promote learning and process improvement
> - Providing adequate training for all participants so they know how to fulfil their role
> - Facilitating meetings
