> Good testing practices, independent of the chosen [[Software Development Lifecycle|SDLC]] model, include the following:
> - For every software development activity, there is a corresponding test activity, so that all development activities are subject to [[Quality Control]]
> - Different test levels (see chapter 2.2.1) have specific and different [[Test objectives]], which allows for testing to be appropriately comprehensive while avoiding redundancy
> - [[Test analysis]] and [[Test design|design]] for a given test level begins during the corresponding development phase of the [[Software Development Lifecycle|SDLC]], so that testing can adhere to the principle of [[Early testing saves time and money|early testing]] (see section 1.3)
> - Testers are involved in reviewing work products as soon as drafts of this documentation are available, so that this earlier testing and defect detection can support the shift-left strategy (see section 2.1.5)[^1]
