> Good testing practices, independent of the chosen [SDLC](Software%20Development%20Lifecycle.md) model, include the following:
> - For every software development activity, there is a corresponding test activity, so that all development activities are subject to [Quality Control](Quality%20Control.md)
> - Different test levels (see chapter 2.2.1) have specific and different [Test objectives](Test%20objectives.md), which allows for testing to be appropriately comprehensive while avoiding redundancy
> - [Test analysis](Test%20analysis.md) and [design](Test%20design.md) for a given test level begins during the corresponding development phase of the [SDLC](Software%20Development%20Lifecycle.md), so that testing can adhere to the principle of [early testing](Early%20testing%20saves%20time%20and%20money.md) (see section 1.3)
> - Testers are involved in reviewing work products as soon as drafts of this documentation are available, so that this earlier testing and defect detection can support the shift-left strategy (see section 2.1.5)[^1]
