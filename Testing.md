> The process within the [[software development lifecycle]] that evaluates the [[quality]] of a component or system and related work products.

> Software testing assesses software [[quality]] and helps reducing the [[risk]] of software [[failure]] in operation.

> Software testing is a set of activities to discover [[Defect|defects]] and evaluate the [[Quality|quality]] of software artefacts. These artefacts, when being tested are known as [[Test object|test objects]].

See also: [[Test objectives]]

> Testing may be dynamic or static. [[Dynamic testing]] involves the execution of software, while [[static testing]] does not. [[Static testing]] includes reviews and static analysis. [[Dynamic testing]] uses different types of test techniques and test approaches to derive test cases.

> Testing is not only a technical activity. It also needs to be properly planned, managed, estimated, monitored and controlled.

> Testers use tools, but it is important to remember that testing is largely an intellectual activity, requiring the testers to have specialised knowledge, use analytical skills and apply critical thinking and systems thinking.
