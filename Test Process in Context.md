[Testing is context dependent](Testing%20is%20context%20dependent.md).

> Testing is not performed in isolation. Test activities are an integral part of the development processes carried out within an organization. Testing is also funded by stakeholders and its final goal is to help fulfill the stakeholdersâ€™ business needs. Therefore, the way the testing is carried out will depend on a number of contextual factors including:
>- Stakeholders (needs, expectations, requirements, willingness to cooperate, etc.)
>- Team members (skills, knowledge, level of experience, availability, training needs, etc.)
>- Business domain (criticality of the test object, identified risks, market needs, specific legal regulations, etc.) 
>- Technical factors (type of software, product architecture, technology used, etc.) 
>- Project constraints (scope, time, budget, resources, etc.) 
>- Organizational factors (organizational structure, existing policies, practices used, etc.) 
>- [Software Development Lifecycle](Software%20Development%20Lifecycle.md) (engineering practices, development methods, etc.) 
>- Tools (availability, usability, compliance, etc.)
>
> These factors will have an impact on many test-related issues, including: test strategy, test techniques used, degree of test automation, required level of [coverage](Coverage.md), level of detail of test documentation, reporting, etc.[^1]
