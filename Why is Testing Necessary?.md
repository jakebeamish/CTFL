> [Testing](Testing.md), as a form of [Quality Control](Quality%20Control.md), helps in achieving the agreed upon goals within the set scope, time, quality, and budget constraints. Testing’s contribution to success should not be restricted to the test team activities. Any stakeholder can use their testing skills to bring the project closer to success. Testing components, systems, and associated documentation helps to identify defects in software,


> Testing may also be required to meet contractual or legal requirements, or to comply with regulatory standards.
### Testing's Contributions to Success

- [Testing](Testing.md) provides a cost-effective means of detecting [defects](Defect.md), which can then be removed by [debugging](Debugging.md). This contributes to the [quality](Quality.md) of the [test object](Test%20object.md)
- [Testing](Testing.md) provides a means of directly evaluating the [quality](Quality.md) of a [test object](Test%20object.md) at various stages of the [SDLC](Software%20Development%20Lifecycle.md). This evaluation contributes to larger project management decisions.
- [Testing](Testing.md) provides users with indirect representation on the development project.  Testers ensure that their understanding of users’ needs are considered throughout the development lifecycle. The alternative is to involve a representative set of users as part of the development project, which is not usually possible due to the high costs and lack of availability of suitable users.
