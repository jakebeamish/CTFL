 Retrospectives (also known as “post-project meetings” and project retrospectives) are often held at the end of a project or an iteration, at a release milestone, or can be held when needed. The timing and organisation of the retrospectives depend on the particular [SDLC](Software%20Development%20Lifecycle.md) model being followed. In these meetings the participants (not only testers, but also e.g., developers, architects, product owner, business analysts) discuss:
- What was successful, and should be retained?
- What was not successful and could be improved?
- How to incorporate the improvements and retain the successes in the future?

The results should be recorded and are normally part of the [Test completion](Test%20completion.md) report (see section 5.3.2). Retrospectives are critical for the successful implementation of continuous improvement and it is important that any recommended improvements are followed up. Typical benefits for [Testing](Testing.md) include:
- Increased test effectiveness / efficiency (e.g., by implementing suggestions for process improvement)
- Increased [Quality](Quality.md) of [Testware](Testware.md) (e.g., by jointly reviewing the test processes)
- Team bonding and learning (e.g., as a result of the opportunity to raise issues and propose improvement points)
- Improved [Quality](Quality.md) of the [Test basis](Test%20basis.md) (e.g., as deficiencies in the extent and [Quality](Quality.md) of the requirements could be addressed and solved)
- Better cooperation between development and [Testing](Testing.md) (e.g., as collaboration is reviewed and optimised regularly
