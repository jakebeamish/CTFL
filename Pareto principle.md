The [[Pareto principle]] states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes (the 'vital few').

[Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft") noted that by fixing the top 20% of the most-reported [[Defect|bugs]], 80% of the related errors and crashes in a given system would be eliminated.

Lowell Arthur expressed that "20% of the code has 80% of the errors. Find them, fix them!"

It was also discovered that, in general, 80% of a piece of software can be written in 20% of the total allocated time. Conversely, the hardest 20% of the code takes 80% of the time. This factor is usually a part of COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model) estimating for software coding.
