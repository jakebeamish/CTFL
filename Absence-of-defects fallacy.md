> It is a fallacy (i.e., a misconception) to expect that software [[Verification|verification]] will ensure the success of a system. Thoroughly testing all the specified requirements and fixing all the defects found could still produce a system that does not fulfill the users’ needs and expectations, that does not help in achieving the customer’s business goals, and that is inferior compared to other competing systems. In addition to [[Verification|verification]], [validation](Validation.md) should also be carried out (Boehm 1981).[^1]
