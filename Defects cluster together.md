A small number of system components usually contain most of the [defects](Defect.md) discovered or are responsible for most of the operational [failures](Failure.md) (Enders 1975). This phenomenon is an illustration of the [Pareto principle](Pareto%20principle.md). Predicted defect clusters, and actual defect clusters observed during testing or in operation, are an important input for risk-based testing (see section 5.2).
