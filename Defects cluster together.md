A small number of system components usually contain most of the [[Defect|defects]] discovered or are responsible for most of the operational [[Failure|failures]] (Enders 1975). This phenomenon is an illustration of the [[Pareto principle]]. Predicted defect clusters, and actual defect clusters observed during testing or in operation, are an important input for risk-based testing (see section 5.2).
