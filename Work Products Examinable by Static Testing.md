> Almost any work product can be examined using [Static testing](Static%20testing.md). Examples include requirement specification documents, source code, [test plans](Test%20plan.md), test cases, product backlog items, [test charters](Test%20charter.md), project documentation, contracts and models.
> 
> Any work product that can be read and understood can be the subject of a review. However, for static analysis, work products need a structure against which they can be checked  (e.g., models, code or text with a formal syntax).
> 
> Work products that are not appropriate for [Static testing](Static%20testing.md) include those that are difficult to interpret by human beings and that should not be analysed by tools (e.g., 3rd party executable code due to legal reasons).[^1]
