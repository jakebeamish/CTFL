> While people often use the terms "[testing](Testing.md)" and "[quality assurance (QA)](Quality%20Assurance.md)" interchangeably, testing and QA are not the same.

> [Testing](Testing.md) is a form of [Quality Control](Quality%20Control.md).
> 
> [Test results](Test%20result.md) are used by [QA](Quality%20Assurance.md) and [QC](Quality%20Control.md). In [QC](Quality%20Control.md) they are used to fix [defects](Defect.md), while in [QA](Quality%20Assurance.md) they provide feedback on how well the development and test processes are performing.
