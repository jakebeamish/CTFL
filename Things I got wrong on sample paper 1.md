[[Regression testing]] is likely to benefit from the use of test tools providing test capture and replay facilities.

| Test management terms | Activity descriptions                         |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| [[Test control]]      | Re-allocation of resources when tests overrun |
| [[Test monitoring]]   | Report on deviation from test plan            |
| Test estimation       | Calculation of required test resources        |
| Incident management   | Tracking of anomalous test results            |
| Configuration control | Maintenance of record of test results         |

Capture-replay tools are NOT used to capture and animate user requirements. They are used to support multi-user testing. They capture aspects of user behaviour. They are the most frequently purchased types of [[Computer Aided Software Testing|CAST]] tool.

---

The [[V-model]] includes the [[Verification|verification]] of designs.

---

The oracle assumption is that the tester can routinely identify the correct outcome of a test.

---

Proving that the software is correct should not be a [[Test objectives]].

---

Boundary Value Analysis is a form of [[functional testing]].

---

Incident reports do not form part of a [[Test plan|test plan]].

---

[[Test execution]] provides the biggest potential cost saving from the use of [[Computer Aided Software Testing|CAST]].

---

Data flow analysis studies the use of data on paths through the code.

---

A [[Failure|failure]] is a departure from specified behaviour.

---

The most important thing about early test design is that it can prevent fault multiplication.

---

Reviews should be performed on specifications, code and test plans.

---

Test cases are designed during test specification.
