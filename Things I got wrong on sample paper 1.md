[Regression testing](Regression%20testing.md) is likely to benefit from the use of test tools providing test capture and replay facilities.

| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| [Test control](Test%20control.md)       | Re-allocation of resources when tests overrun |

| Test estimation                         | Calculation of required test resources        |
| Incident management                     | Tracking of anomalous test results            |
| Configuration control                   | Maintenance of record of test results         |

Capture-replay tools are NOT used to capture and animate user requirements. They are used to support multi-user testing. They capture aspects of user behaviour. They are the most frequently purchased types of [CAST](Computer%20Aided%20Software%20Testing.md) tool.

---

The [V-model](V-model.md) includes the [verification](Verification.md) of designs.

---

The oracle assumption is that the tester can routinely identify the correct outcome of a test.

---

Proving that the software is correct should not be a [Test objectives](Test%20objectives.md).

---

Boundary Value Analysis is a form of [Functional testing](Functional%20testing.md).

---

Incident reports do not form part of a [test plan](Test%20plan.md).

---

[Test execution](Test%20execution.md) provides the biggest potential cost saving from the use of [CAST](Computer%20Aided%20Software%20Testing.md).

---

Data flow analysis studies the use of data on paths through the code.

---

A [failure](Failure.md) is a departure from specified behaviour.

---

The most important thing about early test design is that it can prevent fault multiplication.

---

Reviews should be performed on specifications, code and test plans.

---

Test cases are designed during test specification.
