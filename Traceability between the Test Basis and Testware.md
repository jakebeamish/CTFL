> In order to implement effective [test monitoring](Test%20monitoring.md) and [control](Test%20control.md), it is important to establish and maintain traceability throughout the [Test process](Test%20process.md) between the [test basis](Test%20basis.md) elements, [testware](Testware.md) associated with these elements (e.g., [test conditions](Test%20condition.md), risks, test cases), [test results](Test%20result.md), and detected defects.
> 
> Accurate traceability supports coverage evaluation, so it is very useful if measurable coverage criteria are defined in the [test basis](Test%20basis.md). The coverage criteria can function as key performance indicators to drive the activities that show to what extent the [test objectives](Test%20objectives.md) have been achieved (see section 1.1.1). For example:
>- Traceability of test cases to requirements can verify that the requirements are covered by test cases.
>- Traceability of test results to [risks](Risk.md) can be used to evaluate the level of residual risk in a test object.
>
> In addition to evaluating [coverage](Coverage.md), good traceability makes it possible to determine the impact of changes, facilitates test audits, and helps meet IT governance criteria. Good traceability also makes test progress and completion reports more easily understandable by including the status of test basis elements. This can also assist in communicating the technical aspects of testing to stakeholders in an understandable manner. Traceability provides information to assess product quality, process capability, and project progress against business goals.[^1]
