[[Defect|Defects]] that are removed early in the process will not cause subsequent defects in derived work products. The cost of [[Quality|quality]] will be reduced since fewer [[Failure|failures]] will occur later in the [[Software Development Lifecycle|SDLC]] (Boehm 1981). To find defects early, both [[Static testing]] (see chapter 3) and [[Dynamic testing]] (see chapter 4) should be started as early as possible.
