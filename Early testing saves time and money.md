[Defects](Defect.md) that are removed early in the process will not cause subsequent defects in derived work products. The cost of [quality](Quality.md) will be reduced since fewer [failures](Failure.md) will occur later in the [SDLC](Software%20Development%20Lifecycle.md) (Boehm 1981). To find defects early, both [Static testing](Static%20testing.md) (see chapter 3) and [Dynamic testing](Dynamic%20testing.md) (see chapter 4) should be started as early as possible.
