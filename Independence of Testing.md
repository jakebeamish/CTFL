> A certain degree of independence makes the tester more effective at finding defects due to differences between the author’s and the tester’s cognitive biases (cf. Salman 1995). Independence is not, however, a replacement for familiarity, e.g., developers can efficiently find many defects in their own code.
> 
> Work products can be tested by their author (no independence), by the author's peers from the same team (some independence), by testers from outside the author's team but within the organisation (high independence), or by testers from outside the organisation (very high independence). For most projects, it is usually best to carry out testing with multiple levels of independence (e.g., developers performing component and component integration testing, test team performing system and system integration testing, and business representatives performing acceptance testing).
> 
> The main benefit of independence of testing is that independent testers are likely to recognize different kinds of [failures](Failure.md) and [defects](Defect.md) compared to developers because of their different backgrounds, technical perspectives, and biases. Moreover, an independent tester can verify, challenge, or disprove assumptions made by stakeholders during specification and implementation of the system.
> 
> However, there are also some drawbacks. Independent testers may be isolated from the development team, which may lead to a lack of collaboration, communication problems, or an adversarial relationship with the development team. Developers may lose a sense of responsibility for quality. Independent testers may be seen as a bottleneck or be blamed for delays in release.[^1]
