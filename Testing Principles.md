A number of testing principles offering general guidelines applicable to all testing have been suggested over the years. This syllabus describes seven such principles.

1. [Testing cannot prove the absence of defects](Testing%20cannot%20prove%20the%20absence%20of%20defects.md)
2. [Exhaustive testing is impossible](Exhaustive%20testing%20is%20impossible.md)
3. [Early testing saves time and money](Early%20testing%20saves%20time%20and%20money.md)
4. [Defects cluster together](Defects%20cluster%20together.md)
5. [Tests wear out](Tests%20wear%20out.md)
6. [Testing is context dependent](Testing%20is%20context%20dependent.md)
7. [Absence-of-defects fallacy](Absence-of-defects%20fallacy.md)
